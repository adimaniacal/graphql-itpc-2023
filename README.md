# graphql-itpc-2023

This demo focusses on basics of GraphQL using express-graphql, nodejs and express.

An exercise to implement a GraphQL API. We are using the express middleware express-graphql in the current example.

Technologies used:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [Express-GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/express-graphql/)


## Install dependencies with npm

`npm install`

### To run the examples, run the following commands
The execution of these commands will open up a GraphiQL, an interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE to visualize your queries and mutations.

`node example1.js` will run on `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

`node example2.js` will run on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`

The example queries and mutations could be tried out from the example_queries.txt file in the repo.
